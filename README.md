HOW I SET UP MY PROJECT
Forking the Repository

I began by forking the repository from the original project page onto my personal GitHub account. This step allowed me to have my copy of the Computer Science Department website project.
Cloning and Initial Setup

Once I had the repository in my account, I cloned it to my local machine using Git. This setup allowed me to work on the project locally, making it convenient to modify and test different features.
Making Iterative Changes

Throughout the project, I focused on improving various aspects of the website. I started with the overall layout, ensuring it was intuitive and user-friendly. As I progressed, I worked on individual pages, refining the content, adding relevant visuals, and ensuring accurate information.
Committing Changes Gradually

To maintain a clear track of my progress, I made frequent commits. Each commit was accompanied by a descriptive message summarizing the changes made. This approach helped me manage the project efficiently and allowed for easy tracking of modifications.
Pushing Updates and Branching

After ensuring the changes were functioning as intended, I pushed the updates to my GitHub repository. Additionally, I utilized branching strategies to experiment with different design elements and functionalities without impacting the main project until finalized.
Replicating Website Features

When required, I replicated specific features from other websites, ensuring I built them from scratch without directly copying the code. This approach helped me understand the implementation details better while ensuring the uniqueness of my project.
Finalizing and Submitting

Towards the project deadline, I reviewed the entire website, checked for any pending improvements, and ensured all 10 pages were well-structured, visually appealing, and functionally robust. After these final touches, I committed the last changes and submitted the completed project as a pull request.
